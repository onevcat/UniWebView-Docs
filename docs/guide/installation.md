# Installation

::: warning IMPORTANT
We strongly recommend that you perform a backup before importing UniWebView to your project. If you are using any [version control system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control) (like Git or SVN), it should be definitely safe to continue.
:::

### Unity Asset Store

If you purchased UniWebView from [Unity Asset Store](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/slug/229334), open the Asset Store window from **Window → Asset Store** or **Window → Package Manager**. You could find UniWebView 5 there under **My Assets**, then click "Import".

### UniWebView Store

Besides of Unity Asset Store, we also have [our own store](https://onevcat.gumroad.com/l/uniwebview-5). After purchasing from our store, you could download the `uniwebview_x_y_z.unitypackage` (`x_y_z` in the file name indicates the package version). Open your project in which you want to use UniWebView, then double-click the downloaded file to import it.

## Importing Package

Unity will prompt you with a window to confirm the importing files. Just click "Import" to add all files to your project.

> The minimum deploy target of UniWebView is from iOS 9.0 and Android 5.0 (API Level 21). If you are still using an older deploy target for you
> Unity project, you may have some issues when exporting the project to the final product. Please make sure to update the
> Target minimum iOS Version and Minimum API Level in the player settings.

### Restarting Unity

Restart the Unity app to give it a chance to load the UniWebView bundle for macOS Editor support. Remember to switch your build target in Player Setting
to either iOS or Android, since UniWebView only works on these two platforms. Otherwise, UniWebView gives a warning, saying the platform is not supported yet.

### Optional Steps

After importing UniWebView, you can open the Unity Preferences panel (**Unity → Preferences**) to configure some necessary permissions. In most cases, there is no need to adjust them and your project should build and run well. If your project can build without issues on both iOS and Android, you can skip these steps below and check the [next chapter](./using-prefab.md).

If you have any errors when building, you can use this panel to customize how UniWebView should adjust some behaviors or dependencies installation.

UniWebView uses a post-build script to modify the gradle project and "AndroidManifest.xml" file for the exported Android project.

### Android Manifest

Settings in this section will be used to adjust the final `AndroidManifest.xml` file of the exported project.

#### Uses Cleartext Traffic

Set `usesCleartextTraffic` flag to `true` in the "AndroidManifest.xml". From Android 9.0, all plain HTTP traffic is forbidden by default.

If you need to display plain HTTP content in the web view, turn it on.

#### Write External Storage

Add `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` permission to the "AndroidManifest.xml". It enables storing an image from the web page to the Download folder on the device. 

If you need to download and save any files to disk, turn it on.

#### Access Fine Location

Add `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` permission to the "AndroidManifest.xml". It enables the web view to use the location information. To get the location actually, you also need to call [`LocationService.Start`](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/LocationService.Start.html) before you open a web page.

If you need to use location APIs on the web, turn it on.

### Gradle Build

You can use settings in this section to modify the `build.gradle` behavior when exporting the project. By default, UniWebView
will add all dependencies it needs. However, if you are using another package manager or some embedded libraries, a duplication might
happen when exporting to Android APK file. In this case, you can try to disable a certain option below to let UniWebView use the existing package instead.

#### Adds Kotlin

Whether Kotlin runtime should be added to the project. UniWebView for Android is written in Kotlin and you need the runtime in your project to run the code. It is on by default.

If any other packages of your project is already adding this, you can opt-out this option to skip adding Kotlin to the project.

#### Adds Android Browser

Whether the [androidx.browser package](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/browser) should be added to the project.
UniWebView uses some features in that package. It is on by default.

If any other packages of your project is already adding this, you can opt-out this option to skip adding the browser package to the project.

#### Enable Jetifier

[Jetifier](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/jetifier) migrates your support-library-dependent libraries to compatible with AndroidX.
UniWebView requires `androidx.browser` package, which is only available as an AndroidX package. Making it on can allow to keep using AndroidX support libraries (if there are). It makes your project cleaner.

If you have to use a legacy support library and it cannot be migrated for some reason, disable this setting.

### Auth Callbacks

This is set of OAuth 2.0 settings. You need to set the OAuth 2.0 callback URLs you want to support in this section. See the [OAuth 2.0 guide](./oauth2.md) for more information.

## Next Step

Congratulations! You are prepared to use UniWebView in your project now. Please read [next chapter](./using-prefab.md) to know how to use the simplest prefab way to show a web page.
