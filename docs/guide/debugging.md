## UniWebView Logger

UniWebView could provide detail logs. It helps you to understand what happens in UniWebView.

There are 5 log levels, following the order of verbosity, they are:

- **Verbose**: The most detailed logging level. It prints out almost all events.
- **Debug**: Good for the general debugging purpose. It prints most of the events.
- **Info**: Fewer logs than Debug level, but will cover quite a few important events.
- **Critical**: This is the **default value** of the built-in logger. It only prints out error messages you need to notice.
- **Off**: Turning off the logger.

`UniWebViewLogger` class takes the responsibility to print log out to console on all platforms. You can set the log level by the code below:

```csharp
// Set the log level to Verbose
UniWebViewLogger.Instance.LogLevel = UniWebViewLogger.Level.Verbose;
```

The log message from UniWebView will start with a tag for each platform: `<UniWebView>`, `<UniWebView-iOS>`, `<UniWebView-Android>`, `<UniWebView-macOS>`. It would be helpful if you want to search in your logs.

For more information on `UniWebViewLogger`, please refer to its [documentation](../api/uniwebviewlogger.md).

## Inspecting Web Page

Sometimes, you need to inspect your web page, to modify some DOMs, stylesheets, or watching result of a JavaScript. UniWebView supports to inspect your page in a browser dev tool in Chrome or Safari.

### iOS

On iOS, you need to call the [`SetWebContentsDebuggingEnabled`](/api/#setwebcontentsdebuggingenabled) method first. Then you could just run and show your web page in UniWebView on an iOS device or simulator. 
Follow the [Safari Web Inspector Guide](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/AppleApplications/Conceptual/Safari_Developer_Guide/GettingStarted/GettingStarted.html) to set up your inspector in Safari.
Please be noted, only binaries built with the Debug configuration can be inspected. The Release build does not work.

### Android

On Android, you need to call the [`SetWebContentsDebuggingEnabled`](/api/#setwebcontentsdebuggingenabled) method first. It will allow Chrome to discover and connect to the web view on Android. Follow the [Remote Debugging WebViews](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/remote-debugging/webviews/) topic to know how to use Chrome DevTools with UniWebView.

### macOS

On macOS you need to call the [`SetWebContentsDebuggingEnabled`](/api/#setwebcontentsdebuggingenabled) method first. Then you can right-click on the web view in macOS editor to bring up the context menu. Select the "Inspect Element" in that menu.

::: warning
Due to a memory bug under WebKit and Unity, it might crash your macOS Editor when you stop playing with an inspector showing embedded in a web view. To avoid this, close the inspector first or use it as a standalone window. This issue only happens in the editor and never affect real devices. Please remember to not enable the `SetWebContentsDebuggingEnabled` in your product build. This feature should be only used in development.
