# Release Note

### 5.4.1 (17 May, 2023)

#### Fix

* An issue that the web view crashes on some Android devices when there is no loading callback is registered under Release mode. This was a regression introduced in 5.4.0. If you are using 5.4.0 and has this crash, please upgrade to 5.4.1 to get a fix.

### 5.4.0 (13 May, 2023)

#### Add

* A method to control whether a loading should be started or not. Use `RegisterShouldHandleRequest` to register a callback and returns whether the loading should be started or not. Check [its reference](https://docs.uniwebview.com/api/#registershouldhandlerequest) for more.

#### Fix

* Now web view on iOS 16.4 can also be inspected. However, different from previous versions, you need to call `SetWebContentsDebuggingEnabled` to enable the debugging mode before inspecting the web view on all platforms.

### 5.3.2 (5 Apr, 2023)

#### Fix

* Strip using of methods from `System.Web.HttpUtility` internally to resolve a runtime issue in older Unity versions.

### 5.3.1 (18 Feb, 2023)

#### Fix

* An issue that `SetOpenLinksInExternalBrowser` setting is ignored for links with "target=_blank" attribute. Now the external browser will be used for such links instead of opening the page in place. If `SetOpenLinksInExternalBrowser` and `SetSupportMultipleWindows` is set to `true` at the same time, the external browser will be used.
* Now the activity for OAuth 2.0 flow on Android allows orientation changes. It won't throw an exception anymore when the device is rotated during the flow.

### 5.3.0 (28 Jan, 2023)

#### Add

* Support for customization of Kotlin and Android Browser package versions. This can help to resolve the conflict with other plugins which use another version of these packages.

#### Fix

* Improve the visual effect of the Embedded Toolbar on iOS. Now it has a larger and bold font for the title.
* A better way to find the root view controller for adding UniWebView to on iOS. Now you can implement a `rootViewControllerForUniWebView` method in your app delegate and return the view controller you want UniWebView to be added to. By default, if the app delegate does not implement either `rootViewControllerForUniWebView` or `rootViewController`, UniWebView now also tries to find the top-most view controller instead of the window's direct root view controller.

### 5.2.1 (4 Jan, 2023)

#### Fix

* A crash when an SSL error is encountered during loading a scheme other than "http" or "https" (for example, "wss://" links) on Android.

### 5.2.0 (23 Dec, 2022)

#### Add

* Most of the OAuth flows now support refresh token. Use `StartRefreshTokenFlow` on the flow to start token refresh. For more about OAuth 2.0 support in UniWebView, check [this guide](https://docs.uniwebview.com/guide/oauth2.html#refresh-token).

#### Fix

* A workaround for Facebook login on Android. Facebook is preventing a web view to perform OAuth login on Android, now the `UniWebViewAuthenticationFlowFacebook` will use a desktop browser user-agent to open the login page.
* A crash that caused by orientation change when the camera is presented on Android while the game is landscape but the camera is portrait.
* A crash when taking screenshot when the web view has a zero or negative size. Now under this case, the `CaptureSnapshot` method will give an error `-1002` in its `OnCaptureSnapshotFinished` event.

### 5.1.0 (21 Nov, 2022)

#### Add

* New methods to control the behavior of the loading spinner. Use `SetAllowUserDismissSpinner` to allow or forbid users dismissing the loading indicator; Use `ShowSpinner` and `HideSpinner` to control its visibility programmatically.
* A new API `SetLimitsNavigationsToAppBoundDomains`, it is a wrapper of `limitsNavigationsToAppBoundDomains` for iOS. It limits user's navigation to only pre-defined domains on iOS.

#### Fix

* Improve the delay that on Android the received cookies are not flushed fast enough in some cases. Now a forcibly cookie flush is always performed when closing the web view.
* The Unity InputSystem assembly reference is added explicitly to prevent compiling error on Unity's versions without InputSystem support.
* An issue prevents the package built on macOS 13 SDK.

### 5.0.2 (24 Oct, 2022)

#### Fix

* A potential issue that the post-build Gradle file parses wrongly when using variables.
* The loading spinner is now not shown wrongly when a mail link tapped.

### 5.0.1 (8 Oct, 2022)

#### Fix

* An issue that the exported iOS project cannot be built with Xcode 13.
* A problem which stops the project from compiling when ".Net Framework" profile is used in Unity.

### 5.0.0 (18 Sep, 2022)

::: danger
5.0.0 is a major update of UniWebView. Although most of APIs in UniWebView 5 are compatible with UniWebView 4 and it should be easy enough to migrate, there are still a few breaking changes. If you are using the toolbar in UniWebView 4, although it is still available, but it is deprecated and replaced by the new embedded toolbar. For migration from UniWebView 4 in detail, visit the [Migration Guide](https://docs.uniwebview.com/guide/migration-guide-v4-to-v5.html). To know the highlight of the version, check [this page](https://docs.uniwebview.com/guide/version-highlight.html) for more.
:::

#### Add

* **Built-in OAuth 2.0 support** for Google, Twitter, Facebook, LINE and GitHub. Now your user can login with their account easily and get access token for other API calls on those service. For more about OAuth 2.0 support in UniWebView, check [this guide](https://docs.uniwebview.com/guide/oauth2.html).
* **Customized OAuth 2.0 support** for any other service provider which defines a standard OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Flow.
* Embedded toolbar for both iOS and Android. It replaces the old toolbar on iOS. The new toolbar contains a set of navigation buttons and a title, showing as a part of the web view on top or bottom of the web view frame. For more about embedded toolbar, check [this guide](https://docs.uniwebview.com/guide/embedded-toolbar.html).

#### Fix

* A layout issue which occasionally happens when opening the old toolbar. Now the buttons position should be always correct.
* An issue which causes web view's `Url` property not parsing correctly when it contains some special characters.

#### Deprecate

* The original iOS-only toolbar is now deprecated. Use the new embedded toolbar instead.
* As Xcode 14 drops the support of 32-bit iOS devices, UniWebView 5 will not support 32-bit iOS devices anymore. If you are using UniWebView 4 and still need to support 32-bit iOS devices for a while, please stay with UniWebView 4.

#### Known Issues

* The `WKWebView` on iOS 16 Simulator is broken: the web view process won't connect and no content can be loaded due to a bug inside WebKit and Apple's system. To develop on iOS simulators, please use iOS 15 or earlier versions for now. This issue does not affect any physical devices running iOS 16.

### 4.13.0 (3 Sep, 2022)

#### Add

* A `SetAcceptThirdPartyCookies` method to allow third party cookies on Android. By default, the third party cookies are not allowed for security reason.

* an issue which causes getting JavaScript evaluating result on the pages with UTF code format (a.k.a, characters as `\uXXXX`) will fail on Android.
* Now UniWebView 4 supports from Unity 2019.4. This is a requirement of Unity publisher submission guidelines. If you need to continue using UniWebView 4.12.0 and later versions, please consider to upgrade your Unity version.

### 4.11.2 (6 Apr, 2022)

#### Fix

* An issue that Safe Browsing on iOS will leak its memory when using `Dismiss` to close the web page by code.

### 4.11.1 (23 Feb, 2022)

#### Fix

* Now UniWebView can build with Unity's new Input System enabled. But due to a bug in Unity's Input System, the back button detection on some Android devices may break and cause a stuck state. Before Unity can fix that, it is strongly recommended to use the "Both" option for Input System to get a stable experience.
* An issue that when header is set, the HTML content in iframe tag not shows properly in some cases.
* Fix a problem that the Post Build script edits format of some embedded variables in gradle file incorrectly.

### 4.11.0 (26 Jan, 2022)

* Uses the intent-based way to detect availability of SafeBrowsing. Now the `IsSafeBrowsingSupported` API would give back a more accurate result.
* Removes the requirement of Gradle plugin version of 4.0.1 or later. This fixes some Android build errors on earlier Unity versions which ships with an older Gradle Plugin. However, if you are using `UniWebViewSafeBrowsing` and setting the Target API Level to Android 11 (Level 30), you still need a newer version of Unity and follow the [related guide](https://docs.uniwebview.com/guide/safe-browsing.html) to add `queries` to the `AndroidManifest.xml` file.
* An issue that the toolbar on iOS can be clicked through to the Unity scene.


### 4.10.1 (11 Nov, 2021)

#### Fix

### 4.0.0 (1 Aug, 2020)

::: danger
4.0.0 is a major update of UniWebView. Although most of APIs in UniWebView 4 are compatible with UniWebView 3 and it should be easy enough to migrate, there are still a few breaking changes. For migration from UniWebView 3 in detail, visit the [Migration Guide](https://docs-v4.uniwebview.com/guide/migration-guide.html). To know the highlight of the version, check [this page](https://docs-v4.uniwebview.com/guide/version-highlight.html) for more.
:::

#### Add

* **Safe Browsing Mode support.** Now UniWebView also contains a wrapper for [SFSafariViewController](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safariservices/sfsafariviewcontroller) on iOS and [Custom Tabs](https://developers.google.com/web/android/custom-tabs) on Android. It allows you to browse web pages in a more browser-like level, including sharing cookies or credentials with the system browser. Check the [Safe Browsing guide](https://docs.uniwebview.com/guide/safe-browsing.html) for more information. 
* **Customizable built-in toolbar on iOS.** Now you can set the bar background color, button text, and the text color in the toolbar. Check the [Built-in Toolbar](https://docs.uniwebview.com/guide/built-in-toolbar.html) guide for more information.
* **Add support for Unity 2020.1.** In the latest Unity version, it changes its way of handling native touch events. It may cause some functionality broken in UniWebView 3. UniWebView 4 uses itself in a new way to handle events to ensure working fine on all supported Unity versions. UniWebView 4 itself **supports from Unity 2018.3**.
* **New Post Build Processing system and Preference Panel.** They provide a better way to define the dependencies and help you modify the "AndroidManifest.xml" file without touch it directly.
* **Better permission model.** UniWebView now does not require the write external permission for uploading a photo from the gallery or camera to the web. It also adopts to permission models for Android 10. Other possible needed permission can be setup in the UniWebView Preference Panel.
* An `OnPageProgressChanged` event which will be raised every time the loading progress changes in the web view.

#### Fix

* Now the web view resizes itself when a soft keyboard is showing up and about to cover the text input fields on the page. It keeps the text input visible.

* Audio resource can stop correctly when the web view is closed now.
* The alert pop-up and its text edit views for JavaScript confirm window or HTTP auth now have a better style and alignment.

#### Deprecate

* `SetImmersiveMode` is not needed anymore since the Unity setting is now always respected. This method will not do anything but give an error log instead.

* Now the text input views should be automatically scrolled up on Android when the soft keyboard displays and overlaps them.
* The `ReferenceRectTransform` can calculate the correct final size and position for a non-default resolution setting for screen now.

### 3.16.0 (5 Feb, 2020)

#### Add

* Support for `target="_blank"` links. By default, UniWebView will open the destination URL in the same page even it is attributed by a `_blank` target. If you want to open it in a new page, call `SetSupportMultipleWindows` with `true` and it will create a new web view above the current one to load the new request.

### 3.0.0 (27 Jun, 2017)

::: danger
3.0.0 is a major update of UniWebView. We rewrote the whole software from scratch to bring your experience of using a web view in Unity to a next level. Be caution it is not compatible with UniWebView 2, there are quite a few breaking changes in this version. For migration from UniWebView 2 in detail, visit our [Migration Guide](https://docs-v3.uniwebview.com/guide/migration-guide.html) in documentation. To know the highlight of the version, check [this page](https://docs-v3.uniwebview.com/guide/version-highlight.html) for more.
:::

#### Add

* Better way to set frame of the web view. You can also use a reference `RectTransform` to set position and size.
* Use `WKWebView` instead of `UIWebView` on iOS.
* New pop-up style Unity Editor support on macOS. It is a fully functional tool for debugging purpose.
* A new way to setup bridging between Unity and Cocoa native. Now there is no message sending delay.
* You can now set the position of toolbar to top or bottom on iOS.
* A leveled logger to log all UniWebView related information. See [UniWebViewLogger](https://docs.uniwebview.com/api/uniwebviewlogger.html) documentation for more.
* Use a payload based callback API like transition and JavaScript related methods. It takes more data. See [UniWebViewNativeResultPayload]https://docs.uniwebview.com(/api/uniwebviewnativeresultpayload.html).
* SSL exception for white listed domain. It is useful for a un-trusted certification but you still want to access.
* A method to get current web view HTML content as a string.

#### Fix

* UniWebView Android no longer requires to be the main activity.
* Uploading now could work properly on all supported devices.
* The url scheme based message now supports UTF-8 and url encoding directly.
* Now the customized header field will be existing for all requests until removed, not only the first one.

* An API to enable inline video play for iOS. By default, iOS video play will be pop to full-screen. By calling SetAllowInlinePlay with a true flag, you can play video inline on iOS. Please note you also need to add an "inline" property in your video tag to support it.
* SetCookie and GetCookie methods to set and get a cookie for a specified URL and key.

#### Fix

* A potential issue that cleaning cookie did not work in some case. Since the logic of current cleaning cookie is not correct, we also marked the original CleanCookie method to be obsoleted. You should now use SetCookie method to set a cookie value to empty for cleaning purpose.

::: danger
Notice: Unity dropped Windows Phone 8 support officially from 5.3. UniWebView will not continue development for Windows Phone as well from this version.
:::

Reason: The amount of our Windows Phone users is very few compared to iOS and Android (it is less than 1% share according to report).
However, if we want to to support Windows Store App with Windows Phone 8.1 SDK or Windows 10 SDK, it would take even more time than either of other platforms.

Since the Windows Phone SDK itself is not backwards compatible, the transition from Windows 8 to 8.1 or 10 means we need to rewrite all code in the package.

We have only limited resource. To make sure we could build the asset in a better quality for most of our users, we decided to focus back to iOS and Android only from next version.

The current Windows Phone 8 support (UniWebViewWP.dll) will be kept in later versions of UniWebView for a while, but we are sorry that it doesn't seem to get updated anymore.

---

### 2.4.0 (4 Dec, 2015)

#### Add

* Built-in show/hide transition. You could now show or hide the web view with a transition effect. Currently we support fade in/out and transition from/to one of screen edges. Please take a look at reference of Show() and Hide() for more.
  Add: Recreate new demo scenes as a better tutorial. Now most of the useful features are contained in the demo scenes, with fully commented script to show how to use them.
* Now you can use "ESC" in OS X Editor to go back or close the web view.

#### Fix

* The color of iOS toolbar is now white. This fixed an issue that the clear background tool bar will become black if no web page is underneath.
* Fix an issue which cause show tool bar property not working in some situation.
* Adjust the behavior of insets, it is a preparation for later feature like insets translating. The API of insets remains the same now.

#### Remove

::: danger
This version dropped support for Unity 4.1.4. Now UniWebView starts from 4.2.2. And 1.7.x will be the last versions support Unity version below 4.4 (because there is a compile error in iOS 8 SDK in the exported Xcode project, which is annoying and makes the development harder).
:::

#### Add

* UniWebViewHelper.screenHeight and UniWebViewHelper.screenWidth. You can retrieve the screen size in "point" instead of "pixel" with these two new API. See the migrate guide below for more.
* "tel:" link support for Android. Now you can open the telephone UI by a link like "tel:12345678".

* Trim the url leading and trailing spaces, making the behaviors the same for iOS and Android.

#### Deprecate

* UniWebViewHelper.RunningOnRetinaIOS() is now deprecated due to 3x size of iPhone 6 Plus. Use UniWebViewHelper.screenHeight and UniWebViewHelper.screenWidth to decide the insets for retina display now. See the migrate guide below for more.

#### Remove

* Remove the long-ago deprecated Dismiss().
* Remove support for Unity 4.1.4.

> Migrate Guide - If you are using UniWebViewHelper.RunningOnRetinaIOS() to decide the insets of UniWebView, you may want to look at the Migrate Guide:

Due to introduction of iPhone 6 Plus and its new @3x scale, the old way would not work well. Now, all screen-size-based insets calculation for UniWebView should NOT use RunningOnRetinaIOS anymore. Instead you should use UniWebViewHelper.screenHeight and UniWebViewHelper.screenWidth and specify the point directly. For example, if you want to show a web view taking the upper half of screen, before version 1.7.0, it might be something like this:

    int uiFactor = UniWebViewHelper.RunningOnRetinaIOS() ? 2 : 1;
    int bottomInset = Screen.height / ( 2 * uiFactor );
    _webView.insets = new UniWebViewEdgeInsets(0,0,bottomInset,0);

Right now, with the new API, you can just use this:

    int bottomInset = (int)(UniWebViewHelper.screenHeight * 0.5f);
    _webView.insets = new UniWebViewEdgeInsets(0,0,bottomInset,0);

No more ui factor and device-specified calculation needed.

To make sure you can notice this change, the usage of RunningOnRetinaIOS() will cause an error now. You can just delete all usage of that, and change your insets code like the example above.

---

### 1.6.1 (2 Sep, 2014)

#### Add

#### Add

* A property to get the current page url. You can know on which page now when you using UniWebView.
* An event when the page begins to load. Not only the first page load from code, but also all the page loading by clicking links on the page.

#### Fix

* A mistake in transparent setting method in Android.
* Background can be setting to transparent now in Android, from 2.x to 4.x (and later I think).

### 1.2.0 (7 Dec, 2013)

#### Add

* A spinner is added to web view, which will show when the webpage is under loading. The spinner is on by default, if you don't want it, you can set it not show by the SetShowSpinnerWhenLoading method of UniWebView.
* We also added a text label in the spinner, to show some information to your users.
