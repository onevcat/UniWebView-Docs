summary = """
UniWebView Safe Browsing provides a way for browsing the web content in a more browser-like way, such as Safari on 
iOS and Chrome on Android.

This class wraps `SFSafariViewController` on iOS and "Custom Tabs" on Android. It shares cookies, auto-fill 
completion and other more data with the browser on device. Most of permissions are also built-in supported. You can
use this class for some tasks that are limited for a normal web view, such as using Apple Pay or Progressive Web 
Apps (PWA).

You create a `UniWebViewSafeBrowsing` instance by calling the static `UniWebViewSafeBrowsing.Create` method with a
destination URL. You cannot change this URL once the instance is created. To show the safe browsing, call `Show` on
the instance. The web content will be displayed in full screen with a toolbar containing the loaded URL, as well
as some basic controls like Go Back, Go Forward and Done. 

Browsing web content in `UniWebViewSafeBrowsing` is only supported on iOS and Android. There is no such component in
Unity Editor. Creating and showing a `UniWebViewSafeBrowsing` on Unity Editor will fall back to open the URL in 
external browser by using Unity's `Application.OpenURL`.

[[Properties]]
name = "IsSafeBrowsingSupported"
returnType = "bool"

summary = """
Whether the safe browsing mode is supported in current runtime or not.

If supported, the safe browsing mode will be used when `Show` is called on a `UniWebViewSafeBrowsing` instance.
Otherwise, the system default browser will be used to open the page when `Show` is called.

This property always returns `true` on iOS runtime platform. On Android, it depends on whether there is an Intent 
can handle the safe browsing request. Usually this ability is provided by Chrome, but there are also other browser app
might implement that. If there is no Intent can open the URL in safe browsing mode, or the handling app is set to 
disabled in Android system, this property returns `false`.

To use this API on Android when you set your Target SDK to Android 11 or later, you need to add the correct 
intent query explicitly in your AndroidManifest.xml, to follow the Package Visibility 
(https://developer.android.com/about/versions/11/privacy/package-visibility). Add `queries` as a subnode of the 
`manifest` tag:

  <queries>
    <intent>
      <action android:name="android.support.customtabs.action.CustomTabsService" />
    </intent>
  </queries>
</manifest>

// To use it:
if (UniWebViewSafeBrowsing.IsSafeBrowsingSupported) {
    // Safe Browsing Mode is available on current device.
