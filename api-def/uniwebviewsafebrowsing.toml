summary = """
UniWebView Safe Browsing provides a way for browsing the web content in a more browser-like way, such as Safari on 
iOS and Chrome on Android.

This class wraps `SFSafariViewController` on iOS and "Custom Tabs" on Android. It shares cookies, auto-fill 
completion and other more data with the browser on device. Most of permissions are also built-in supported. You can
use this class for some tasks that are limited for a normal web view, such as using Apple Pay or Progressive Web 
Apps (PWA).

You create a `UniWebViewSafeBrowsing` instance by calling the static `UniWebViewSafeBrowsing.Create` method with a
destination URL. You cannot change this URL once the instance is created. To show the safe browsing, call `Show` on
the instance. The web content will be displayed in full screen with a toolbar containing the loaded URL, as well
as some basic controls like Go Back, Go Forward and Done. 

Browsing web content in `UniWebViewSafeBrowsing` is only supported on iOS and Android. There is no such component in
Unity Editor. Creating and showing a `UniWebViewSafeBrowsing` on Unity Editor will fall back to open the URL in 
external browser by using Unity's `Application.OpenURL`.

[[Properties]]
name = "IsSafeBrowsingSupported"
returnType = "bool"

summary = """
Whether the safe browsing mode is supported in current runtime or not.

If supported, the safe browsing mode will be used when `Show` is called on a `UniWebViewSafeBrowsing` instance.
Otherwise, the system default browser will be used to open the page when `Show` is called.

This property always returns `true` on iOS runtime platform. On Android, it depends on whether the Chrome app, 
which underhood provides the ability of safe browsing, is installed or not.
