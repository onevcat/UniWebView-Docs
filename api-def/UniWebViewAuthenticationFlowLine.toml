A predefined authentication flow for LINE.

This implementation follows the flow described [here](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/line-login/).

LINE authentication flow is a bit different from the other standard authentication flows. Please read the link
above carefully to understand it.

See the [OAuth 2.0 Support](/guide/oauth2.html) for a more detailed guide of authentication in UniWebView.

To allow the Google flow working, at least you need these steps:

1. Setting `Client Id` (Channel Id), `iOS Bundle Id` and `Android Package Name` in the `UniWebViewAuthenticationFlowLine` inspector.
2. Setting `Scope` and at least contains `profile` in the `UniWebViewAuthenticationFlowLine` inspector.
3. Check the "Support LINE Login" option in the `UniWebView` preference panel.
