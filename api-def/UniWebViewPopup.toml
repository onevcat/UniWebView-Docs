A lightweight handle for controlling a popup window opened by UniWebView.

A popup window is a temporary overlay web view created when `SetSupportMultipleWindows(true, ...)` is enabled and
`target=\"_blank\"` or `window.open()` is triggered. It is not a full `UniWebView` component, but provides limited
control through this handle.
