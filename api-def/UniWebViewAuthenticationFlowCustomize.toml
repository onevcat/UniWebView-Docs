summary = """
A customizable authentication flow behavior.

For a guide of using this class, please refer to the [Common Flow](/guide/oauth2.html#common-flow)
section in theOAuth 2.0 Support guide.

Besides of the predefined authentication flows, such as Twitter (`UniWebViewAuthenticationFlowTwitter`) or Google
(`UniWebViewAuthenticationFlowGoogle`), this class allows you to determine the details of the authentication flow,
such as entry points, grant types, scopes and more. But similar to other target-specified flows, it follows the same
OAuth 2.0 code auth pattern.

If you need to support other authentication flows for the platform targets other than the predefined ones, you can
use this class and set all necessary parameters. It conforms to the `IUniWebViewAuthenticationFlow` and runs the 
standard OAuth 2.0 flow and gives out a `UniWebViewAuthenticationStandardToken` as the result.

If you need to support authentication flows other than `code` based OAuth 2.0, try to derive from
`UniWebViewAuthenticationCommonFlow` and implement `IUniWebViewAuthenticationFlow` interface, or even use the underneath
`UniWebViewAuthenticationSession` to get a highly customizable flow.

It inherits from `UniWebViewAuthenticationCommonFlow`, which is in turn a `MonoBehaviour` and can be attached to a Game 
Object. The usual way to use this class is attaching it to an existing Game Object in the scene and setup it in the inspector.

summary = """
The config object which defines the basic information of the authentication flow.

It contains basic information of an OAuth 2.0 service provider, including the `authorizationEndpoint`, `tokenEndpoint`
and `responseType`, etc.

Although you can set the values for a `config` instance by code, a more common way is attaching this
script to a Game Object and setup it in the Unity inspector UI.

The client Id of your OAuth application.
