summary = """
Abstract class and general control for other authentication flows. This class determines the global behaviors of the 
authentication flow, such as whether to start authentication as soon as the script `Start`s, and whether to use private
mode to authenticate the user.

This is a super and abstract class for all concrete auth flow. You are not expected to use this class directly.
Instead, to start a customized auth flow, you can use the `UniWebViewAuthenticationFlowCustomize` class.

Whether to use private mode to authenticate the user. If `true` and the device supports, the authentication

On iOS, this works on iOS 13 and later.

On Android, it depends on the Chrome version and might require users to enable the incognito mode (and support
for third-party use) in Chrome's settings. Check settings with `chrome://flags/#cct-incognito` and
`chrome://flags/#cct-incognito-available-to-third-party` in Chrome to see the current status.
