summary = """
Strongly typed metadata emitted with every Safe Browsing callback.

Native Custom Tabs and `SFSafariViewController` events send JSON payloads describing the lifecycle transition,
including timestamps and the native source. UniWebView parses that payload into this class so you can inspect the data
without touching JSON manually.

`EventKind` indicates which stage triggered the callback:

- `Unknown`: Payload could not be parsed, or native side omitted an event name.
- `NavigationStarted`: Initial navigation began.
- `NavigationFinished`: Page load finished successfully.
- `NavigationFailed`: Page load failed. Inspect the `Raw` payload for error details.
- `TabHidden`: User dismissed the Safe Browsing tab (maps to `OnSafeBrowsingClosed` / `OnSafeBrowsingFinished`).
