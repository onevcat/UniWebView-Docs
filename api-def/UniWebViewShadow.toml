summary = """
Represents the drop shadow styling applied to the UniWebView container.

The values are expressed in Unity pixel units (points on iOS, pixels on Android) and map to the native shadow APIs.
`UniWebViewShadow` is typically used with `UniWebView.SetShadow` to apply or remove a shadow that follows the same
corner radii as the web view.

summary = """
Creates a new shadow style.

- `radius`: Blur radius of the shadow. Higher values produce a softer shadow.
- `opacity`: Shadow opacity in the range `0.0 - 1.0`.
- `offsetX` / `offsetY`: Horizontal and vertical offset of the shadow relative to the web view.
- `color`: Base color of the shadow. Its alpha channel combines with `opacity`.
- `spread`: Additional expansion applied to the shadow outline.
